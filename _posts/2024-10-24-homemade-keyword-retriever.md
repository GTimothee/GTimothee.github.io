> In this blog post I show you how I build a simple yet efficient keyword retriever for a RAG system, using the whoosh library.

## Motivation
I found myself building a RAG system for question answering, and it is not as easy as you might think. 

The main problem comes when dealing with technical documentation. Implementing a similarity search-based RAG will not help you much. Firstly, the embedding model does not know the keywords, so it cannot embed them properly. Secondly, when a user asks a question, the text is rarely "similar" to the chunk that contains the answer, if that makes sense.

Although it does not solve all your problems, a first step towards improving your RAG in this setting is well known: you shall add a keyword retriever in addition to the similarity search-based retriever, as the both of them are complementary. 

This post will be useful for you in at least two ways: if you are curious about how a keyword retriever works in practice, and if, like me, you are using a database that does not have a keyword retriever included. Some might argue that I could have use the retriever from langchain but from what I understood it either loads all the documents in memory (not optimal) or needs elasticsearch as a backend, which my team and I did not want to do, as we weren't using it for anything else in the project at hand.
